# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
A system that will identify road traffic signs alongside the road as the driver commutes.

In this project we are aiming to create an application that will identify and classify road signs as the driver commutes and notify the driver in case 
they miss them to aid in avoiding car accidents caused by distracted driving. For this project we will be using Python and its multiple libraries to 
train a Machine Learning model, create a registration and login form and the graphic user interface.

We will begin with installing Python 3, if you don't already have it installed you can download it at https://www.python.org/, and after that we 
should install the Anaconda data science environment to get access to Jupyter Notebook which we will use to develop the system. If you don't already have it
installed, you can download it at https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution/.

Once that's done, navigate to the Anaconda command prompt where we will install the following libraries using pip:
	- Matplotlib
	- Keras
	- Opencv
	- PIL
	- Tensorflow
	- SQLite
	- Tkinter
	- Numpy
	- Pandas

We will also require a dataset of traffic signs which we will use to train and test the Machine Learning model. This dataset can be downloaded at 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/.

After we have successfully installed Python 3, the Anaconda data science environment and all the required libraries, and downloaded our dataset of 
traffic signs we are ready to begin the actual coding and we will start by training the model using the downloaded dataset of traffic signs.

Here is the code to train the model and test it's accuracy internally:

When we have trained a model with a satisfying accuracy score, it's time to put that model to use and implement it within a graphic user interface,
which will also have a login form and enable the user to test the system with the computer's webcam.

Here is the code for the graphic user interface:

This is the output generated from the above code:
